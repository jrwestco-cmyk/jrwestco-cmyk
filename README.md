## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### 
Jillian Westcott is Coastal Carolina University alumni and earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Graphic Design and Sports Marketing. After graduating she got a job working for a NASCAR team in Norh Carolina. She found a way to mash both her love for creating/designing and sports all in one job with a team that she loved. She later went on to work for Flow Automive Companies and now is furthering her education at Arizona State University to earn her Masters Degree in Graphic Information Technology. 

This will be Jillian's First semester of her graduate program and she is hoping to get a lot out of this web development class and maybe design her own websites one day. She enjoys the idea of being able to bring something to life in more ways than just a graphic on Adobe illustrator and coding will give her the freedom to think differently and do so. Her main technical skills are in graphic design, this will be her first coding class. Her favorite hobby is she enjoys running.
